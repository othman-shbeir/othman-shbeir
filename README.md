## 👋 About Me

I’m a Computer Science valedictorian and AI/ML engineer focused on computer vision, recommender systems, and data analytics. As a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Java (JavaFX, Streams, Spring, multithreading), I’ve mentored 150+ students, and as an AI Engineer Intern at AURA I shipped computer-vision pipelines with PyTorch/TensorFlow and YOLO. I build human-centered ML end to end—from data prep and modeling to evaluation and deployment—using Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Pandas/NumPy, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, Node.js/NestJS, React, Docker, and AWS/GCP, plus BI with Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. I care about clean architectures, reproducible experiments, and readable APIs backed by tests and lightweight CI. I don’t just watch movies or anime—I build recommender systems that help thousands decide what to watch next.
